# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for my Pinterest app.

## Data Collection

I will literally store no data. None. Zero. Zilch.

## Purpose

This app is for personal use only. I made it for myself because I needed it.

## A Note on Pinterest's API

Pinterest has the worst API access ever. Getting approved to use their API is an absolute nightmare, and the hoops you have to jump through are unreasonable for what should be simple personal use. If you're reading this because you're trying to do the same thing - good luck, you'll need it.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, I'm not sure why, since there's nothing to ask about. But feel free to reach out anyway.
